misc. snippets
---------------

web-gather.py :: attempts to gather links and emails addresses from a given url/host
  -- results.txt [sample output file]

isitup.py :: checks if a url/host is responsive

newnym.py :: connects to a TOR control port and sends the newnym command every 90 seconds

rk-aliases.py :: uses bash aliases to hide user and file activity in a semi rootkit-like manor

multi-server.py :: TCP shell server capable of handling multiple incoming connections. presents user with
                   a shell that displays the current working directory and also the ability to 'cd'.
                   note: 'cd' might not sound too exciting but many shells don't have the feature ;-)
